- 👋 Hey! 
I am samiksha mahure, currently in my second year of bachelor's in computer science. 👩‍🎓
Talking about my technical skills I'm skilled in c/c++ , HTML and CSS. 
Apart from technology I am inclined towards art🎨, designing and books📚.
If you want I can create pretty graphics for you, and sketches as well.
Currently honing my skillset of DSA and web development and turning my hands to open source, if you have ken about open source, it would be great if you give a piece of advice to me on that😀.
